# Changelog

# Version 0.25.0

**Breaking Change**: This version contains an API change that breaks with prior
versions.

* Callback functions (render callbacks, app handlers, ...) receive a single _Context_ parameter that can
  be consumed directly but is intended to be consumed using parameter destructuring. This introduces an
  API breaking change.
* Upgraded almost all build dependencies (no impact on production code)
* Improved code packaging process
* Moved to new mono-repo

# Version 0.24.0

* `updateElement` emits custom events `updatestart` and `updateend` to notify listeners when an update is
  applied to an element
* custom elements created using `define` emit custom events `connect` and `disconnect` to notify listeners
  when the custom element is connected/disconnected from the DOM

# Version 0.23.0

**Breaking Change**: This version contains an API change that breaks with prior
versions.

* `define` accepts an object as the optional last parameter allowing you to set
  observed (HTML element) attributes as well as observed (JavaScript element)
  properties
* Added performance tests to benchmark render performance

# Version 0.22.2

* Fix handling of `null` and `undefined` when updating bound attributes of custom elements
* Improve bundles
* Rework examples

# Version 0.22.1

* Fix `null` value error when using `null` inside a placeholder of `wecco.html`

# Version 0.22.0

**Breaking Change**: This version contains an API change that breaks with prior
versions.

* Change signature of _app_ functions to always receive `ctx` as the first
  parameter. This allows a very much easier use of `bind` when building views.
* `null` is allowed for functions that return an `ElementUpdate`. A `null` value
  causes no change in the element`s DOM.
* Minor dev dependency upgrades
* Example uses vite.js (instead of webpack)
